# epinow-regional
 Framework for calculating R using epinow2 and covidregionaldata

This is a set of R scripts, bash scripts, HTML and included JavaScript to
put together a web page which presents R(t) values calculated using
the [EpiNow2](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2) package using data drawn
from the [covidregionaldata](https://epiforecasts.io/covidregionaldata)
package.

It uses the [rt_vis](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rt_vis)
package by [Hamish Gibbs](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/gibbs.hamish).
